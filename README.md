# pandas-challenge-1

## Overview
In this project I review some client data from an imported CSV.

## Part 1
First, just looking through to get an idea using some basic functions like describe / shape / head. Then, moving on to reviewing specific columns and groupings / filters of those columns to glean insights like getting the top 5 and topmost client based on the number of transactions/entries in the data file.

## Part 2
During this section I'm transforming the data to add in new data points like the shipping of each entry and the total cost / total price.

## Part 3 & 4
In these two parts I double check my transformations from part 2 as well as format the findings into a concise summary DataFrame.
